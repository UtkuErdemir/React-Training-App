# Age Of Empires Units Web App

- It is based on ReactJS
- I created my own components.
- I created tests with React Utils and Jest. Some areas test coverage percentage is low but general coverage is +%80.
- I used SCSS but it is app's styling is not good enough :D 
- Data source is inside of the src/data-source folder. I generated fake api with that using JSON Web Server.
- "json-server --watch .\age-of-empires-units.json --port 8000" i use this command when i inside of the data-source directory in terminal for the JSON Web Server.
- App has some minor issues it can be fix in the future.
